Here a few to know about that have specific links to running: 1.Boosted Mood and Energy Levels A study published in 2018 found that running for as little as 15 minutes can improve mood and energy levels, and it had more of an effect for participants than meditation, deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation. 2.Boosted Memory, Focus, and Task-Switching Because running causes biochemical substances called endocannabinoids to be released in the bloodstream and into the brain, it optimizes brain function . 3.Improved Cardiovascular Health A research review published in 2020 found that increased rates of participation in running, regardless of how frequently you run, show lower risk of cardiovascular-related mortality",

Muscles Targeted The treadmill primarily helps build your cardiovascular endurance, says De Leon, but walking or running will also work the lower body muscles, including the quadriceps, glutes, hamstrings, and calves, according to ACSM. It’s not the most effective way to build these muscles, but using the treadmill will help to maintain them, Summerville adds. Perks You can adjust the speed and incline to increase intensity or perform an interval or HIIT workout, says De Leon. Compared with the elliptical and rower, a treadmill has been found to burn more fat"

Singh said, “It provides stability and strength to the core muscles, which contain your oblique, lower back, and all of the side muscles. This exercise will also help enhance your twisting stability.To perform this move, go down on your fours. Make sure your hands are directly under your shoulders with your back and legs aligned in a straight line. Contract your abs and rotate and pivot towards the right. Press your hands while knocking your feet on the other side. Repeat this with the other leg as well.“Reverse lunges are an excellent way to work your hamstrings, glutes, calves and quads, while providing you with lower body strength,” said Singh. It is a great option for beginners as it is easy to control the backward motion.First, stand shoulder-width apart. Then, inhale and carefully take a big step backwards with your right foot as you bend both knees to 90 degrees, making sure your weight is distributed evenly between both legs. Now, exhale and extend both knees while transferring your weight onto your left foot. At the same time, raise your right foot to bring your knee near your chest. Lower your right leg to the starting position. Repeat this on the other side"

      long_description:"The DASH diet works by limiting not only sodium but also saturated fat — both of which can be detrimental to heart health, says Kimberley Rose-Francis, RDN, CDCES, a dietitian and diabetes educator in Sebring, Florida. A diet that's heavy in salt can drive up blood pressure, which puts unnecessary strain on the heart muscle, Rose-Francis says. Saturated fat, on the other hand, can increase cholesterol levels. “Cholesterol has the potential of blocking or decreasing the flow of blood to the heart,” Rose-Francis says, adding that restricted blood flow can lead to heart attack and stroke.The DASH diet also works by increasing foods that provide fiber, lean protein, and other nutrients thought to help lower blood pressure.right up arrow. People who want to lower their blood pressure should combine the diet with other healthy lifestyle approaches to manage hypertension, such as getting more exercise, losing weight, cutting back on alcohol consumption, and managing stress levels. Quitting smoking and getting plenty of sleep are also recommended and can improve your overall health"
